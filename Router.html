<h2>Creating a Router</h2>

<h3>Setting up the virtual machine</h3>
<p>Assuming you are using a virtual machine, with a new clone created you will want to adjust the network adapters in the settings. To do so, ensure you have the instance you plan to use as a router selected and select setting at the top. Then click the network tab. Only Adapter 1 and 2 need to be enabled. Adapter 1 should be set to <span class="altColor">Bridged Adapter</span> and Adapter 2 should be set to <span class="altColor">Internal Network</span>.</p>

<h3>Configuring Netplan</h3>
<p>To start, you need to edit the netplan config. It can be found in the <span class="altColor">/etc/netplan/</span> directory. For my machine, it was <span class="altColor">/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml</span>. YAML is very specific about formatting. White space is done with spaces and does not allow for tabs. For the config, you must determine which ethernet connection is for WAN and for LAN. If using Virtual Box, the name of the connection seems to be consistant. In my case <span class="altColor">enp0s3</span> is used for WAN and <span class="altColor">enp0s8</span> is for LAN.
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="router">
<code class="language-bash">sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml</code>
</pre>
<p>Bellow is what the config file should look like</p>
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="router" data-output="1-11">
<code class="language-bash">network:
   ethernets:
      enp0s3:
         addresses: []
         dhcp4: true
         optional: true
      enp0s8:
         addresses: [10.69.69.1/24]
         dhcp4: no
         dhcp6: no
   version: 2</code>
</pre>
<p>I decided to go with the 10.69.69.0 network with the router at 10.69.69.1, but this can be adjusted as desired.</p>
<p>To ensure the config is working, enter the following command. If there is no output, it should have been successful.</p>
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="router">
<code class="language-bash">sudo netplan apply</code>
</pre>

Here is more sample text meant to caption the bellow terminal example. This is to be multiple lines if neccissary. I want to test how long this will become before it wraps to a new line.
